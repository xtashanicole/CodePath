## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
James Houston, Antonio Martinez, Anitya, Angel Garcia

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
When I was creating the start stop button, my start button dissapeared. I asked my boyfriend for help, he just told me to go over my code to 
see if I had any errors. I then went into the slack and asked for help too, they tried but I didnt find the solution there either. Turns out I
had a tiny typo lol. IT TOOK ME HOURS TO FIND! 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I want to know, how or if we are required to remember a certain amount of code when being a web developer, some of the things I did, I 
copied and pasted without further knowledge, otherwise I was typing because I love to type. So when we do start working professionally, 
is it required that we know how to do that off the top of our heads?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
OMG! I wish I started sooner, I'm an avid procrastination (something I'm working on), if I had the opportunity I would youtube somethings
to add on to my memory game. I'm literally a beginner. So this was amazing to me anyways, sometimes simplicity is key.
